    "description_tab_body": "With over two years of experience as a web developer, my name is Gabriel Luna. Since childhood, I have always been an extremely curious person. My journey into the world of video games began when I was fortunate enough to receive a PlayStation 2 from my father. From that moment on, I explored incredible worlds, honed my motor skills, and built meaningful connections with people who remain an important part of my life to this day. Although my current career is not directly tied to games, they have always been a compass guiding my professional choices and experiences in other fields. Today, I strive to enhance my skills as a game developer, dedicating my time to personal projects and collaborating with individuals who share the same dream: to turn a passion for games into a fulfilling and full-time career.",
